  - Normalized current
- CSV and ATF files for custom protocols
- Excel spreadsheet used for managing epxerimental data: [`ephys_data_info.xlsx`](./data/../ephys_data_info.xlsx)

ABF files were collected with ClampEx version 8 (Axon Instruments), and requires ClampEx or ClampFit (version $\geq$ 8) to open and manipulate.
